This program works with very specific input that you have to give:
For the first input after the message " requesting take off: ", you need to type the name of the plane exactly as it is given with no spaces before, in between and after the string.
If you get the second input with the message " requesting to land: ", you need to type the name of the plane for the rest of the program to work.
Finally, if you get the third and last input message " requesting emergency landing: ", you need to type the plane name again for it to work.
